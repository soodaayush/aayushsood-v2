# React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Commonly Used Hooks

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

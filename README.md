## Inspiration

This is a second iteration of my portfolio website, as I felt that my first one looked old and stale. I decided on using a framework (Next.js) to develop this new website to make the process easier.

## Challenges

Understanding how Next.js works and making sure I wrote code in a framework-based manner.

## Lessons Learned

I learned Next.js and its differences when compared to React and other frameworks. 

## The Website

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you can explore my portfolio, reading list, and résumé.

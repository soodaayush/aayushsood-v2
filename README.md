## Inspiration

The first version of my portfolio felt… dated. I wanted something cleaner, more dynamic, and easier to maintain. So I gave it a complete makeover, this time powered by Next.js. It's not just a redesign; it's a rethinking of how I present myself online.

## Challenges

Switching to a full-featured framework like Next.js came with its own learning curve. Routing, SSR, file-based structures; it was a lot at first. Adapting my habits from plain React to the Next.js way of doing things was a key challenge.

## Lessons Learned

- How Next.js differs from traditional React projects
- File-based routing and API routes
- Performance optimization and static site generation
- The value of frameworks in scaling personal projects

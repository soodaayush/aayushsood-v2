In the summer of 2025, I attended [Shad](https://www.shad.ca/) at the [University of New Brunswick](https://unb.ca/), a STEAM and entrepreneurship program for Canadian high school students in grades 10–11. On paper, the description sounds very generic; almost interchangeable with dozens of other summer programs. But in reality, SHAD was anything but. It was a month defined by late nights, unfamiliar challenges, constant learning, and a community of people who pushed me to think harder, work faster, and believe more confidently in my own ideas. It was, quite literally, one of the most unforgettable months of my life.

# What is Shad?

Shad is a month-long STEAM and entrepreneurship program for Canadian high school students that runs on university campuses across the country. Fundamentally, Shad is about bringing together curious, motivated students and pushing them outside their comfort zones through hands-on problem solving and collaboration.

Throughout the program, students work in teams to tackle real-world design challenges, attend lectures and workshops led by professors and industry professionals, and develop ideas under tight timelines. Days are long and fast-paced, often blending technical work, creative thinking, and presentation skills into a single project.

What makes Shad different from a typical summer program is its intensity and community. You are constantly surrounded by people who are as driven and curious as you are, which creates an environment where learning happens rapidly; and where you quickly realize how much more capable you are than you initially thought.

# This sounds fun... How do I Participate?

If this sort of thing excites you; there is an application process that can be found on Shad's [website](https://www.shad.ca/). The application typically opens around September and closes in January (this is as of the Shad 2026 application cycle).

The application consists of basic information about yourself, essay questions about your experiences, and your academics. The application is not lengthy, but it requires you to think through your motivations for attending the program as well as the life experiences that made you who you are today. I found that completing this application last year definitely prepared me for a similar structure in university applications as well. I typically receive many questions regarding the essays and academics in particular, so lets break that down.

In terms of essay questions, Shad is not looking for applicants to have cured all infectious diseases in the world by the time they're 15. They are simply looking for individuals who are curious about the world around them and who are also driven, creative, and community-driven. All of these elements can be demonstrated in a multitude of methods: whether it be being an executive of a club at your school, being an actor on a theatrical production, volunteering at youth summer camps, or many more. The advice I have to offer in this regard is to really tie your experiences to the essay questions; that way, Shad understands how your experiences have shaped your personality and who you are today as a result of it.

In regard to academics, you are required to upload a report card containing your grades for the last academic year. Shad is not strict with high grade requirements; they just want to see if you are academically ready for the program. In my opinion, the academics are not as important as the personality you show in your essays, so I would recommend focusing on your story rather than your grades.

After being accepted to the program, you present your top choices for university placements and Shad will try their best to place you in your top universities.

For me, I was placed at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, New Brunswick from June 29 - July 25. New Brunswick was not too far from my hometown, Halifax, Nova Scotia, so it was an easy commute compared to others' experiences.

# First Week

I do not really remember the first week of Shad as much as the rest, as it was mostly awkward conversations about what your name was and where you were from. Although, it is worth mentioning as I find it to be the period that can influence the degree to which you enjoy your time during the program.

My Shad campus in particular had 52 Shads (the participants) along with Program Assistants (PAs) and Program Directors (PDs). PDs coordinate the activities each day while PAs help the PDs in facilitating the undertakings. As a Shad, you will spend significantly more time with your PAs than your PDs.

Most of my fellow Shads were far from home, with most of them flying into Fredericton. A large minority of the group of 52 were from Ontario, particularly in the Greater Toronto area; but there were pockets of people from the Prairies and even Atlantic Canada.

Most of the week was spent participating in team-building activities and games, which were designed for us to connect with one another at a deeper level.

Part of the experience at Shad is crafting your very own meals in a hopefully classy manners (cannot speak for everyone) at the mess hall. If you want insight into the sort of meals crafted at Shad UNB, please take the time to peruse the Shad UNB Food Reviews [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shadunb_foodreviews_25/) account!

We were also introduced to the Design & Entrepreneurship project; a project where you and a team tackle the most complex problems facing Canadian society. The same topic is presented to all Shad campuses and varies by year. For Shad 2025, this was the problem statement: How might we design innovative and sustainable transportation solutions that meet the needs of people in Canada? More on that later.

# Trips

Part of the experience of Shad is embarking on trips around your university. 

On our first trip we visited the [Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station](https://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/reactors/power-plants/point-lepreau-nuclear-generating-station/), the only one in Atlantic Canada. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take photos, but I learned about how nuclear power plants operate and the security measures required in order to protect it. These trips are scheduled in advance so that we are able to have the privilege to visit these otherwise inaccessible sites.

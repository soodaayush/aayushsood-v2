In the summer of 2025, I attended Shad at the University of New Brunswick, a STEAM and entrepreneurship program for Canadian high school students in grades 10–11. On paper, it sounds generic, almost interchangeable with dozens of other summer programs. But that description completely misses the point.

Shad was not just a program. It was a month where time felt distorted. Days were long, nights were longer, and somehow the entire experience disappeared far too quickly. It was a stretch of late nights, uncomfortable challenges, constant learning, and people who pushed me to think harder, work faster, and believe more confidently in my own ideas. Looking back now, it was the longest and shortest month of my life, and one that quietly reshaped how I see learning, collaboration, and myself.

# What is Shad?

Shad is a month-long STEAM and entrepreneurship program for Canadian high school students that runs on university campuses across the country. Fundamentally, Shad is about bringing together curious, motivated students and pushing them outside their comfort zones through hands-on problem solving and collaboration.

Throughout the program, students work in teams to tackle real-world design challenges, attend lectures and workshops led by professors and industry professionals, and develop ideas under tight timelines. Days are long and fast-paced, often blending technical work, creative thinking, and presentation skills into a single project.

What makes Shad different from a typical summer program is its intensity and community. You are constantly surrounded by people who are as driven and curious as you are, which creates an environment where learning happens rapidly; and where you quickly realize how much more capable you are than you initially thought.

What I didn’t realize before arriving was how immersive this environment would be. When you spend every day surrounded by people who are just as curious and driven as you are, growth becomes unavoidable. You start to raise your own standards without being asked, not because you feel pressured, but because the people around you inspire you to do better.

# This sounds fun... How do I Participate?

If this sort of thing excites you; there is an application process that can be found on Shad's [website](https://www.shad.ca/). The application typically opens around September and closes in January (this is as of the Shad 2026 application cycle).

The application consists of basic information about yourself, essay questions about your experiences, and your academics. The application is not lengthy, but it requires you to think through your motivations for attending the program as well as the life experiences that made you who you are today. I found that completing this application last year definitely prepared me for a similar structure in university applications as well. I typically receive many questions regarding the essays and academics in particular, so lets break that down.

In terms of essay questions, Shad is not looking for applicants to have cured all infectious diseases in the world by the time they're 15. They are simply looking for individuals who are curious about the world around them and who are also driven, creative, and community-driven. All of these elements can be demonstrated in a multitude of methods: whether it be being an executive of a club at your school, being an actor on a theatrical production, volunteering at youth summer camps, or many more. The advice I have to offer in this regard is to really tie your experiences to the essay questions; that way, Shad understands how your experiences have shaped your personality and who you are today as a result of it.

In regard to academics, you are required to upload a report card containing your grades for the last academic year. Shad is not strict with high grade requirements; they just want to see if you are academically ready for the program. In my opinion, the academics are not as important as the personality you show in your essays, so I would recommend focusing on your story rather than your grades.

After being accepted to the program, you present your top choices for university placements and Shad will try their best to place you in your top universities.

In hindsight, the application felt less like a test and more like an invitation to reflect. Shad wasn’t asking who I was trying to be, but who I already was, and why that mattered. That mindset carried into the program itself. The people who thrived weren’t the ones who had done the most impressive things on paper, but the ones who were open to learning, questioning, and growing alongside others.

For me, I was placed at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton, New Brunswick from June 29 - July 25. New Brunswick was not too far from my hometown, Halifax, Nova Scotia, so it was an easy commute compared to others' experiences.

# First Week

![Whale Watching](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/room.webp)

The first week was awkward in the way all beginnings are. Conversations revolved around names, hometowns, and small talk, but underneath that surface level was a shared uncertainty. Everyone was trying to figure out where they fit, how much of themselves to show, and whether they belonged in a room full of unfamiliar faces.

That week mattered more than I realized at the time. It quietly set the tone for the rest of the month. The willingness to talk to someone new, to sit with people you didn’t know yet, and to lean into discomfort made the difference between simply attending Shad and truly experiencing it.

My Shad campus in particular had 52 Shads (the participants) along with Program Assistants (PAs) and Program Directors (PDs). PDs coordinate the activities each day while PAs help the PDs in facilitating the undertakings. As a Shad, you will spend significantly more time with your PAs than your PDs.

Most of my fellow Shads were far from home, with most of them flying into Fredericton. A large minority of the group of 52 were from Ontario, particularly in the Greater Toronto area; but there were pockets of people from the Prairies and even Atlantic Canada.

We were all divided into house groups, which are essentially little groups within the 52 that sometimes partake in activities and trips together. I was placed in the Blueberries house group, which in my opinion had the best community I could ever ask for! Every day, we were provided a vague schedule outlining the busy day that lie ahead of us.

![Schedule](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/schedule.webp)

Most of the week was spent participating in team-building activities and games, which were designed for us to connect with one another at a deeper level. Our daily routines consisted of lectures, labs, meals, recreational activities, and social time before our mandated curfew.

![Paper Tower Challenge](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/paper-tower-challenge.webp)

Part of the experience at Shad is crafting your very own meals in a hopefully classy manners (cannot speak for everyone) at the mess hall. If you want insight into the sort of meals (such as meatballs and jello) crafted at Shad UNB, please take the time to peruse the Shad UNB Food Reviews [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shadunb_foodreviews_25/) account!

![Food](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/food.webp)

We were also introduced to the Design & Entrepreneurship (DE) project, a month-long, team-based challenge where students work together to tackle some of the most complex problems facing Canadian society. The project emphasizes human-centred design, iteration, and entrepreneurship, pushing teams to move from broad problem spaces to tangible, well-justified solutions under tight timelines. Each year, all SHAD campuses work on the same overarching challenge, allowing ideas to emerge from a shared national problem. The project culminates in a pitch-style competition, where teams present their solutions to judges and compete for prizes. For SHAD 2025, the problem statement was: How might we design innovative and sustainable transportation solutions that meet the needs of people in Canada? More on that later.

# Trips

![Camping](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/camping.webp)

Part of the experience of Shad is embarking on trips around your university. 

On our first trip we visited the [Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station](https://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/reactors/power-plants/point-lepreau-nuclear-generating-station/), the only one in Atlantic Canada. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take photos, but I learned about how nuclear power plants operate and the security measures required in order to protect it. These trips are scheduled in advance so that we are able to have the privilege to visit these otherwise inaccessible sites.

Our second trip we visited [Mactaquac Provincial Park](https://www.parcsnbparks.ca/en/parks/10/mactaquac-provincial-park) to go camping. One trip that is almost consistent with all Shad campuses is camping, so I would definitely recommend bringing all of your treasured camping supplies (including powerbanks!). 

![Campfire](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/campfire.webp)

This was my first time camping and I believe that it could not have been better spent than with a group that quickly felt like a community, where learning and connection happened just as much outside the program as within it.

![Travelling in Saint John](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/saint-john.webp)

On our third trip we travelled south to Saint John, New Brunswick. The goal of the trip was to explore the various markets that surrounded us along with having a tour of the [Port of Saint John](https://www.sjport.com/) from the CEO, Craig Estabrooks. The tour allowed me to learn extensively about the complex process of how ports operate, especially in one of the largest ports in the Atlantic provinces.

![Huntsman Marine Science Centre](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/st-andrews-aquarium.webp)

On our fourth and final trip we visited St. Andrews, New Brunswick, a northern town known for its presence of whales. Our group visited the [Huntsman Marine Science Centre](https://www.huntsmanmarine.ca/aquarium) and conducted a lab where we used microscopes to analyze microorganisms in the sea! One of the most exciting parts of this trip was whale watching, but I unfortunately have no photos of the whales. Although, the journey in the ocean contained some beautiful views.

![Seals](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/seals.webp)

Overall, the trips allowed us to step outside the structure of campus life and experience Shad from a different perspective. They gave us the chance to explore new environments, connect more deeply with one another, and momentarily slow down in the midst of an otherwise fast-paced program. Whether it was learning beyond a classroom, sharing long conversations, or simply being present in unfamiliar settings, the trips strengthened our sense of community and made the experience feel more balanced. They reminded me that some of the most meaningful moments at Shad didn’t come from scheduled activities, but from shared experiences that brought us closer together.

# Design & Entrepreneurship Project

![DE Cohort](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/de-cohort.webp)

A couple of sections ago I referenced a fun component of Shad called the Design & Entrepreneurship project. Initially, there was not much attention paid towards this activity, but it ramped up during the second and third weeks of the program. All 52 of us were sorted into groups of 4-5 members and were given an overall topic to tackle within the problem statement. 

The general topic we were given was surrounding the social stigma of using public transportation. This was an issue I had already been familiar with, as public transportation in Halifax had always been viewed as undesirable due to various factors. Our group was not sure about what social issue to tackle, so we asked Canadians across the country using a simple survey. 

In the data, we examined several issues: lack of access to buses, infrequent arrivals for public buses, and a lack of hygiene within buses. Our group decided on tackling hygiene, meaning that we were going to develop a solution that improved hygiene in buses in Halifax.

![Business Model Canvas](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/business-model-canvas.webp)

After understanding the issue we needed to solve, we had to develop a [Business Model Canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model_canvas). A Business Model Canvas is essentially a way to think through whether an idea could exist in the real world. Instead of focusing only on the solution itself, it forces you to consider who the idea is for, what problem it solves, and how it could realistically be implemented and sustained. At Shad, we used it to move beyond just having an interesting concept and start thinking about practicality; costs, partnerships, and how people would actually interact with what we were designing. It helped turn abstract ideas into something more grounded and intentional.

![HyRide Logo](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/hyride-logo.webp)

After crafting our business model, we established our company, HyRide. HyRide is a public transit hygiene solution designed to make buses cleaner, more reliable, and more appealing to riders. The company installs an efficient disinfectant misting system on buses that sanitizes interiors in under a minute between routes and performs deeper overnight cleaning, reducing delays caused by manual cleaning while improving overall cleanliness. By pairing this system with added hygiene features (such as trash bins and hand sanitizer dispensers) and a strong public-facing marketing campaign, HyRide aims to change public perception of buses from unhygienic to a smart, safe, and convenient transportation choice. Ultimately, HyRide helps transit agencies increase ridership, reduce delays, and rebuild trust in public transit.

![HyRide Finances](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/hyride-finances.webp)

My role within the organization is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Taking on the role of CFO forced me into unfamiliar territory. I was suddenly responsible for decisions that affected the entire team, often without feeling fully confident in the numbers I was working with. There were moments of frustration, confusion, and doubt, especially late at night when the calculations refused to make sense. But working through that uncertainty taught me more than getting the right answer ever could. It showed me that leadership often means staying engaged even when you don’t feel prepared.

![HyRide Poster](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/hyride-poster.webp)

The day of the pitch competition rolled around with most teams, including us, being nervous about what lied ahead. The competition consisted of two stages: a brief presentation of your team poster to judges where you deliver your elevator pitch of your product, and the pitch presentation to other judges and your Shad cohort.

![HyRide Preliminary Pitch](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/de-preliminary-pitch.webp)

Our team did incredibly well at delivering a concise and cogent elevator pitch to our judges; and they appeared to be very interested in our product. Following the first stage, we were brought to the auditorium, where we were tasked to deliver a presentation to our peers and judges showcasing our months-long hard work. 

![HyRide Pitch](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/de-pitch.webp)

Each presentation at most is five minutes followed by a Q&A period between groups and judges. Standing on stage, I didn’t feel polished or confident. I felt aware of every mistake and every word I wished I had phrased differently. But watching my teammates present with clarity and conviction reminded me that success isn’t always about individual performance. Sometimes it’s about trusting the people beside you and knowing when to step back and let the team shine.

![HyRide Group Picture](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/hyride-group.webp)

Overall, The DE project taught me that good ideas are rarely fully formed at the start. They emerge through iteration, disagreement, and pressure, and often improve only after being challenged by others. More than anything, it showed me how much stronger ideas become when you stop trying to solve a problem alone.

# The Final Week

![UNB Mess Hall](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/unb-mess-hall.webp)

The final week moved at a pace that felt unfair. Every moment carried weight, knowing it was limited. Conversations felt more intentional, laughter came easier, and goodbyes began forming long before anyone actually left.

I made it a goal for myself to really spend time with every single person in the cohort and get to know everyone as much as I can. I realized that I did not connect with everyone as much as I would like to and did not want to waste the final week with my community.

Sometime during the final week, in between presentations and quiet moments that felt heavier than the days before, I learned that I had been elected valedictorian by my peers. The news didn’t feel triumphant as much as it felt grounding; a reminder of the people and shared experiences that had shaped the month.

![Speech Podium](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/speech-podium.webp)

To celebrate our time at Shad, a banquet was hosted by the staff of Shad, even inviting our parents to observe. Part of my role as valedictorian was to deliver a culminating speech outlining our journey and the future ahead.

![Final Shad Group Picture](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/final-shad-group-picture.webp)

At the end, we returned to our rooms and began packing our bags, quietly realizing that the month we had been living so fully was coming to an end. On our final night, we stayed up late signing each other’s monthbooks, filling pages with inside jokes, memories, and promises to keep in touch. The next morning came too quickly. Those with early flights were bussed away, one by one, while a few of us stayed back on campus, lingering longer than necessary. The goodbyes were harder than I expected; brief hugs, quiet words, and the shared understanding that something meaningful was ending, even though its impact would last far beyond that morning.

# The People

![Group Picture #1](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/people-1.webp)

When I think back on Shad, the first thing that comes to mind isn’t a lecture, a project deadline, or even a trip; it’s the people. I arrived on campus carrying a suitcase and a lot of uncertainty, surrounded by faces I didn’t recognize and names I couldn’t yet place. Within days, those strangers became the constant presence of my month: the people I learned with, struggled alongside, laughed with, and eventually couldn’t imagine leaving behind.

What made the people at Shad special wasn’t just how accomplished or driven they were, but how open they chose to be. Everyone showed up as themselves, curious, passionate, and unafraid to care deeply. Conversations rarely stayed on the surface. It was normal to talk about ambitions, fears, and values late into the night, sitting on residence floors or walking across campus long after we were supposed to be asleep. Being in an environment where curiosity was celebrated made vulnerability feel natural.

![Group Picture #2](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/people-2.webp)

There was a quiet kind of support woven into everyday moments. People stayed behind to help teammates refine ideas, explained concepts without judgment, and checked in on one another when the pace of the program became overwhelming. During the DE project especially, I saw how collaboration could coexist with intensity and how competition never overshadowed empathy. We pushed each other to be better, not out of pressure, but out of belief in one another.

As the weeks passed, routines formed. Certain people became the ones you always sat next to, the ones you walked back to residence with, the ones you looked for in a crowded room. Inside jokes accumulated, group chats filled up, and shared exhaustion turned into shared pride. Somewhere along the way, Shad stopped feeling like a program and started feeling like a community.

![Group Picture Containing Stardew Valley](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/stardew-valley.webp)

Saying goodbye was far harder than I had anticipated. It was difficult to accept that the people who had become such a central part of my life in just a month would soon be scattered across the country again. Yet, there was also comfort in knowing that these connections weren’t defined by proximity, but by the experiences we shared and the growth we witnessed in one another.

Shad brought together people who challenged the way I think, reminded me why I love learning, and showed me the power of being surrounded by those who care deeply, not just about success, but about each other.

Long after the details of lectures and projects blur together, it’s these people I will remember most. They are the reason Shad feels less like a month I attended and more like a chapter I lived.

# Living on Campus

Living on campus for a month was an entirely new experience, and one that surprised me in how much it changed my perspective. From unpacking my suitcase in a small dorm room to navigating shared bathrooms and common spaces, it was my first taste of independence on this scale. Simple routines like cooking breakfast in the mess hall, walking across campus to lectures, or staying up late with friends took on a new significance when you were responsible for managing your own time and space.

![Karaoke Night](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/karaoke-night.webp)

There was something special about sharing a floor with a group of people you were just getting to know. Late-night conversations, quiet study sessions, and the small moments in between classes gave life to the friendships that would define the month. Living together forced us to navigate disagreements, coordinate schedules, and celebrate little wins, from making a meal together to solving a tough DE project challenge.

Even the mundane parts, like laundry or tidying a shared room, became moments of reflection. They reminded me that independence isn’t just about freedom; it’s about responsibility, respect, and learning to take care of yourself while being part of a community.

![Coffee House](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/coffee-house.webp)

By the end of the month, campus life no longer felt like a temporary experience. It felt like a small, self-contained world where I had grown into routines, relationships, and habits that I might not have discovered otherwise. Living on campus taught me that independence is not just about doing things on your own, but about learning how to connect, collaborate, and coexist with others in meaningful ways.

# Reflection & Takeaways

![Tree Group Picture](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/tree-group-picture.webp)

Looking back, Shad was far more than a summer program; it was a month that challenged me in ways I didn’t expect and taught me lessons I will carry long after. It pushed me to step out of my comfort zone, to try things I wasn’t sure I could do, and to trust in my own abilities while relying on the people around me.

One of the biggest takeaways was how much growth comes from collaboration. The DE project, late-night discussions, and even small daily interactions reminded me that ideas become stronger when they are shared, challenged, and refined alongside others. I learned that leadership is not about having all the answers, but about listening, contributing, and helping others shine.

![Lunch Group Picture](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/lunch-group-picture.webp)

Shad also taught me about resilience and adaptability. The pace was intense, mistakes were inevitable, and not every plan worked perfectly, but that is where the real learning happened. I realized that failure is not a setback but an opportunity to iterate, improve, and see problems from a new perspective.

Beyond skills and knowledge, Shad left me with a renewed sense of curiosity and a deeper appreciation for community. The people I met, the late-night conversations, the shared struggles, and even the quiet moments alone all shaped the way I think, collaborate, and approach challenges today.

![Camping Group Picture](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/camping-group-picture.webp)

Shad did not give me all the answers. Instead, it gave me better questions, stronger habits, and a deeper appreciation for learning alongside others. It reminded me that growth is rarely comfortable, but it is always worth leaning into. A month may seem short on paper, but sometimes that is all it takes to change the way you move forward.

# Advice for Future Shads

![Farmers Market Group Picture](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/farmers-market-group-picture.webp)

If I could give advice to future Shad participants, it is simple: Shad is what you make of it. The program will only be as meaningful as the energy, curiosity, and effort you bring. Step out of your comfort zone, ask questions, explore new ideas, and dive into every experience, big or small.

For those who are on the fence about applying, I would say this: the program can feel intimidating at first, but the people, the experiences, and the challenges make it worth it. You will meet students from all over the country who are curious, driven, and welcoming. Even if you are unsure about whether you “fit in,” you will quickly find a place in the community and discover strengths in yourself that you didn’t know were there.

![Public Display of Appreciation](/assets/blog/shad-unb-2025/pda.webp)

Finally, take moments to reflect. Pause, think about what you are learning, and appreciate how far you have come. The lessons, memories, and friendships you take away will last long after the month ends. At the end of the day, the experience is yours to shape, and the more you put into it, the more you will get out of it.

Shad is what you make of it. The opportunities are there, but it’s your willingness to engage, reflect, and care that turns the experience into something meaningful.

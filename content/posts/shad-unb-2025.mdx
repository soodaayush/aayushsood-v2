In the summer of 2025, I attended [Shad](https://www.shad.ca/) at the [University of New Brunswick](https://unb.ca/), a STEAM and entrepreneurship program for Canadian high school students in grades 10–11. On paper, the description sounds very generic; almost interchangeable with dozens of other summer programs. But in reality, SHAD was anything but. It was a month defined by late nights, unfamiliar challenges, constant learning, and a community of people who pushed me to think harder, work faster, and believe more confidently in my own ideas. It was, quite literally, one of the most unforgettable months of my life.

# What is Shad?

Shad is a month-long STEAM and entrepreneurship program for Canadian high school students that runs on university campuses across the country. Fundamentally, Shad is about bringing together curious, motivated students and pushing them outside their comfort zones through hands-on problem solving and collaboration.

Throughout the program, students work in teams to tackle real-world design challenges, attend lectures and workshops led by professors and industry professionals, and develop ideas under tight timelines. Days are long and fast-paced, often blending technical work, creative thinking, and presentation skills into a single project.

What makes Shad different from a typical summer program is its intensity and community. You are constantly surrounded by people who are as driven and curious as you are, which creates an environment where learning happens rapidly; and where you quickly realize how much more capable you are than you initially thought.

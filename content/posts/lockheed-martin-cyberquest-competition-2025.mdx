Earlier this year, my team and I at our school's Tech Club heard about an opportunity to compete at Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity competition for high schools. The [Lockheed Martin CYBERQUEST Competition](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/communities/cyber-quest.html), held in-person across Canada, the U.S., and Australia, is an annual cybersecurity event for high school students. In fact, the nearest Lockheed Martin office from our school was just a short distance away in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The competition consisted of Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, which are exercises that involve finding a specific text string within a given problem. For an example, a CTF problem may involve investigating a website's source code to find a specific string, such as Y0U_F01ND_M3. Teams that gain the most points out of solving multiple CTF challenges in the three hour competition win 1st place, while others place in the top 3. Each high school team consisted of 3-5 members, so we decided on bringing me and four other passionate Tech Club members to this competition. Categories of challenges spanned from Web-based attacks, Cryptography, Social Engineering, and more. Our team was not fully aware of these concepts, so we spent the next few preparing for the competition, which will be hosted in the Dartmouth office on March 29, 2025. We decided on registering our team name as the Bay View High School SharkBytes.

# Preparation

Our team wasn't quite sure on how to prepare for such an event, especially when it was our first time learning about the broad field of cybersecurity. We eventually stumbled on a platform that prepares you for CTF competitions, called [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). PicoCTF offered problems of varied difficulty and a broad selection of categories, which was perfect for preparing for the competition. Our team made an effort to solve one challenge a day leading up to the competition. We made it an essential objective to especially focus on problems that involve technical areas that we were not aware about, so we can expand our skillsets while focusing less on what we already know. I led a workshop for all Tech Club members on PicoCTF and how CTF challenges work, as I found it to be the perfect time to introduce cybersecurity as a career possibility for all Tech Club members.

# Competition day

The day of the competition rolled around and we were all excited to enter the office of Lockheed Martin and learn the art of cybersecurity. We entered inside an area of the building and encountered two other teams there. The rules of the competition were explained to us, here's a quick summary:

- Challenges ranged in difficulty and point value.
- Teams could spend points for hints.
- Web usage was allowed, with the exception of posting on forums to find answers.
- Generative AI was also allowed, but copying and pasting the challenge prompt into the AI was not allowed.

The competition commenced and we got straight to cracking the various cybersecurity problems presented to us.

We tackled problems concerning Forensics, General Trivia Questions, Operating Systems, and more. Our team worked well, as we all each tackled a separate problem in an effort to gain the most points possible. We had decided on tackling the easier problems that gave us little points first to gain a large amount of points, then moved onto harder problems. I personally tackled problems involving packet analysis through Wireshark, phishing problems, and problems involving websites. It was very competitive, as all three teams were at one point leading one another, but only ever so slightly. The competition felt very tense yet very friendly at the same time as it was a bunch of computer nerds typing away at their computers. After a very close competition, our team placed 3rd, and we had a pizza party. Our team received medals and a nice trophy, and we celebrated.

# Takeaways

This competition taught us a variety of tools and techniques. We learned tools such as

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
- [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)

Due to this being our first team competition, I learned many soft skills, such as leadership, communication, and tasking your team in real time during a contentious competition such as this.

# Impact and What's Next

This experience was really insightful for me as I really did not consider cybersecurity as a career choice. Due to this competition, it is definitely something that is worth exploring, as the protection of information will continue to stay as a problem for years to come. As a result, I encourage those who are on the fence about trying cybersecurity to try out a CTF competition such as the Lockheed Martin CYBERQUEST (if you are currently in high school), as it will open up possibilities for you in the field of cybersecurity. As we look ahead, we're excited to apply what we've learned to future Tech Club events, and hopefully return to CyberQuest even stronger next year.

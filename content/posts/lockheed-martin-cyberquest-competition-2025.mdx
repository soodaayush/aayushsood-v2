Earlier this year, me and my team at our school's Tech Club heard about an opportunity to compete at Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity competition for high schools. This competition is the [Lockheed Martin CYBERQUEST Competition](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/communities/cyber-quest.html), which, as of 2025, is hosted at in-person locations in Canada, the United States, and Australia. In fact, the nearest Lockheed Martin office from our school was just a short distance away in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia (the picture of the office is shown above). The competition consisted of Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, which are exercises that involve finding a specific text string within a given problem. For an example, a CTF problem may involve investigating a website's source code to find a specific string, such as Y0U_F01ND_M3. Teams that gain the most points out of solving multiple CTF challenges win 1st place, while others place in the top 3. Categories of challenges spanned from Web-based attacks, Cryptography, Social Engineering, and more. Our team was not fully aware of these concepts, so we spent the next few months to prepare for the competition, which will be hosted in the Dartmouth office on March 29, 2025.

# Preparation

Our team wasn't exactly sure on how to prepare for such an event, especially when it was our first time learning about the broad field of cybersecurity. We eventually stumbled on a platform that prepares you for CTF competitions, called [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). PicoCTF offered problems of varied difficulty and a broad selection of categories, which was perfect for preparing for the competition. Our team made it an effort to solve one challenge a day leading up to the competition. We made it an essential objective to especially focus on problems that involve technical areas that we were not aware about, so we can expand our skillsets while focusing less on what we already know.

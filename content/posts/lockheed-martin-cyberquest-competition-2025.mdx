Earlier this year, me and my team at our school's Tech Club heard about an opportunity to compete at Lockheed Martin's cybersecurity competition for high schools. This competition is the [Lockheed Martin CYBERQUEST Competition](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/communities/cyber-quest.html), which, as of 2025, is hosted at in-person locations in Canada, the United States, and Australia. In fact, the nearest Lockheed Martin office from our school was just a short distance away in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia (the picture of the office is shown above). The competition consisted of Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, which are exercises that involve finding a specific text string within a given problem. For an example, a CTF problem may involve investigating a website's source code to find a specific string, such as Y0U_F01ND_M3. Teams that gain the most points out of solving multiple CTF challenges win 1st place, while others place in the top 3. Each high school team consisted of 3-5 members, so we decided on bringing me and four other passionate Tech Club members to this competition. Categories of challenges spanned from Web-based attacks, Cryptography, Social Engineering, and more. Our team was not fully aware of these concepts, so we spent the next few months to prepare for the competition, which will be hosted in the Dartmouth office on March 29, 2025. We decided on registering our team name as the Bay View High School SharkBytes.

# Preparation

Our team wasn't exactly sure on how to prepare for such an event, especially when it was our first time learning about the broad field of cybersecurity. We eventually stumbled on a platform that prepares you for CTF competitions, called [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/). PicoCTF offered problems of varied difficulty and a broad selection of categories, which was perfect for preparing for the competition. Our team made it an effort to solve one challenge a day leading up to the competition. We made it an essential objective to especially focus on problems that involve technical areas that we were not aware about, so we can expand our skillsets while focusing less on what we already know. I led a workshop for all Tech Club members on PicoCTF and how CTF challenges work, as I found it to be the perfect time to introduce cybersecurity as a career possibility for all Tech Club members.

# The Competition day

The day of the competition rolled around and we were all excited to enter the office of Lockheed Martin and learn the art of cybersecurity. We entered inside an area of the building and encountered two other teams there. The rules of the competition were explained to us, so I will provide a summary: Problems of the competition are of varying point value, where easier problems are worth less points than those that are harder to tackle. Problems allowed you to spend a certain amount of points to gain hints. Web usage was allowed, with the exception of posting on forums to find answers. Generative AI was also allowed, which was interesting, except you cannot copy and paste the problem into the AI. The competition commenced and we got straight to cracking the various cybersecurity problems presented to us.

We tackled problems concerning web exploits, general trivia questions, Operating Systems, and more. Our team worked well, as we all each tackled a separate problem in an effort to gain the most points possible. We had decided on tackling the easier problems that gave us little points first to gain a large amount of points, then moved onto harder problems. It was very competitive, as all three teams were at one point leading one another, but only ever so slightly. The competition felt very tense yet very friendly at the same time as it was a bunch of computer nerds typing away at their computers. After a very close competition, our team placed 3rd, and we had a pizza party. Our team received medals and a nice trophy, and we celebrated.
